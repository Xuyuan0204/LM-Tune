        "output": "The Great Depression was a severe global economic downturn that lasted from 1929 to 1939. It was caused by several factors, including the stock market crash of 1929, structural weaknesses in the economy, low consumer spending, high unemployment, and a lack of confidence in the banking system. Other contributing factors included overproduction of commodities, reliance on borrowing to finance investments, agricultural overproduction, and a decrease in international trade."

        "output": "Cellular respiration in plants is a complex process in which the plant converts glucose into usable energy. The process begins when the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and combines it with water to form glucose molecules using the energy from sunlight. This glucose is then broken down into simpler molecules of carbon dioxide and water. During this process, the energy released is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, the ATP can also be broken down further to produce heat energy, which helps to sustain the plant's temperature. The carbon dioxide and water molecules produced in the process are then released back into the environment to complete the cycle."

Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other."
